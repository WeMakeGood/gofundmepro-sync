# Claude Code Context Files

This directory contains Claude Code instruction files and development context documentation that are primarily useful for AI assistants and development history tracking.

## Contents

- **CLAUDE.md** - Main implementation guide and architecture instructions for Claude Code
- **CONTINUATION_SUMMARY.md** - Post-compact continuation summary with mission status
- **CONTINUOUS_SYNC_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md** - Complete continuous sync architecture documentation
- **DATETIME_FILTERING_SOLUTION.md** - Technical solution for API datetime filtering issues
- **PHASE_4_CLI_MANAGEMENT_SCOPE.md** - Scope document for CLI and management implementation
- **PHASE_4_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md** - Summary of advanced CLI and health monitoring
- **VALIDATION_FINDINGS.md** - Live API validation findings and implementation adjustments
- **DOCUMENTATION_STATUS.md** - Development documentation status tracking

## Purpose

These files provide:
- **Historical Context**: Development decisions and problem-solving approaches
- **Technical Insights**: Validated API patterns and architecture decisions
- **Implementation Guidance**: Detailed specifications for Claude Code continuation
- **Problem Solutions**: Documented solutions to technical challenges

## For Developers

While these files contain valuable technical insights, primary developer documentation is maintained in:
- **README.md** - Main project documentation
- **DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md** - Production deployment instructions
- **docs/API_DOCUMENTATION_INSIGHTS.md** - API integration guidance

## Maintenance

These files should be preserved as they contain:
- Validated technical solutions
- Historical development context
- Proven implementation patterns
- Critical architecture decisions
