# Supporter Statistics Fix Documentation

## Issue Summary

During system validation, it was discovered that all supporter records had NULL values for lifetime donation calculations (`lifetime_donation_amount`, `lifetime_donation_count`, `first_donation_date`, `last_donation_date`), even though transaction data was correctly synced.

## Root Cause

The supporter sync process was intentionally setting these fields to NULL with comments indicating they would be "calculated from transactions," but no automatic calculation process was implemented during full syncs.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Immediate Data Fix
- **Applied comprehensive update** to all 9,475 supporter records
- **Calculated lifetime values** from successful transaction data
- **Verified accuracy** using validation tools

### 2. Code Enhancement
- **Enhanced `SupporterSync.fullSync()`** to automatically recalculate stats after sync
- **Added `recalculateAllLifetimeStats()` method** for bulk updates
- **Maintained existing transaction-level updates** for individual changes

### 3. Monitoring & Maintenance Tools
- **Created `scripts/recalculate-supporter-stats.js`** with validation and fixing capabilities
- **Added `npm run fix:supporter-stats`** command for easy maintenance
- **Added validation command** to detect future discrepancies

## Verification

**Before Fix:**
```
Total supporters: 9,475
Supporters with lifetime amounts: 0
All supporter_summary data: NULL or incorrect
```

**After Fix:**
```
Total supporters: 9,475
Supporters with calculated amounts: 8,895 (93.9%)
Prospects (no donations): 580 (6.1%)
Average lifetime value: $579.48
Supporter_summary view: Fully functional
```

## Usage Commands

### Validation
```bash
# Check for any data discrepancies
node scripts/recalculate-supporter-stats.js validate

# Validate database schema integrity
npm run db:validate
```

### Maintenance
```bash
# Fix all supporter statistics from transaction data
npm run fix:supporter-stats

# Fix single supporter by ID
node scripts/recalculate-supporter-stats.js single <supporter_id>
```

## Prevention

### For New Data
- ✅ **Full supporter syncs** now automatically calculate lifetime stats
- ✅ **Individual transaction syncs** already update supporter stats immediately
- ✅ **Database validation tools** detect discrepancies

### Monitoring
- **Weekly validation** recommended: `node scripts/recalculate-supporter-stats.js validate`
- **Monthly maintenance** if needed: `npm run fix:supporter-stats`

## Impact

### Data Integrity
- ✅ **Supporter summary views** now display accurate segmentation
- ✅ **Donor value tiers** correctly calculated (Small Donor, Major Donor, etc.)
- ✅ **Engagement status** accurate (Recent, Active, Lapsed, etc.)
- ✅ **MailChimp integration** receives correct lifetime values

### Example Verification
**Chris Frazier (chris.frazier@wemakegood.org):**
- ✅ Lifetime Amount: $34.70 (5 successful transactions)
- ✅ Donor Tier: Small Donor ($25-$99 range)
- ✅ Engagement: Recent (17 days since last donation)
- ✅ Frequency: Regular (4-10 donations)
- ✅ Recurring: $5.47/month active plan

## Technical Details

### Calculation Logic
```sql
-- Lifetime amount from successful donations
SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'success' AND transaction_type = 'donation' 
    THEN gross_amount ELSE 0 END)

-- Lifetime count from successful donations  
COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'success' AND transaction_type = 'donation' 
     THEN 1 END)

-- First and last donation dates
MIN/MAX(CASE WHEN status = 'success' AND transaction_type = 'donation' 
        THEN purchased_at END)
```

### Integration Points
- **Supporter full sync** → Automatic recalculation
- **Transaction upsert** → Individual supporter update  
- **Manual maintenance** → Bulk recalculation script
- **Validation tools** → Discrepancy detection

This fix ensures **long-term data integrity** and **accurate donor analytics** for all current and future data.
